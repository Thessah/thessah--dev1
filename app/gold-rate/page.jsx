          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
            <p>
              The Live Retail Gold Rate in Dubai is prominently displayed in gold trading locations such as the Gold Souk, Deira. This is not the global spot rate but a maximum rate that jewellers and dealers are allowed to charge on the gold content of retail sales and has a small margin built into it to offset bullion delivery and customs charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purchase price of gold jewelry in Dubai is therefore a combination of the current Dubai retail gold rate plus a making charge. The price of the gold is set but the making charge can be negotiated.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Thessah, we source our gold responsibly and price our jewelry transparently. Our calculator above helps you understand the complete breakdown of costs including metal value, making charges, wastage, and applicable VAT.

          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
            <p>
              The International Gold Rate or Spot rate that we display on our charts is the current gold rate reported from real transactions taking place globally. Gold is a commonly traded metal and the price will fluctuate as rates are negotiated and agreed upon internationally.
            </p>
            <p>
              The gold bullion market also has access to the LBMA Gold Fix, a benchmark rate set twice every trading day in London and used as guidance for global trades.
            </p>
            <p>
              The international gold rate is an important factor that can impact the gold price in Dubai. As a major player in the global gold market, Dubai is influenced by the fluctuations in international gold rates. When international gold rates increase, the gold price in Dubai is likely to follow suit and vice versa.

        {/* Gold Carat Rates */}
        <section className="bg-white rounded-xl border p-6">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Gold Carat Rates Explained</h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
            <p>
              The Carat or Karat of Gold is a mark of the purity of the metal and an important factor to consider when buying gold jewelry. The carat rating of gold refers to the amount of pure gold in a piece of jewelry or bullion.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-4">
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Common Gold Purities:</h3>
              <ul className="space-y-2 text-sm">
                <li><strong>24K Gold:</strong> 99.9% pure gold - the highest purity. Softer and more malleable, ideal for investment and some jewelry.</li>
                <li><strong>22K Gold:</strong> 91.6% pure gold - traditionally popular in UAE and India. Good balance of purity and durability.</li>
                <li><strong>18K Gold:</strong> 75% pure gold - more durable for everyday wear, commonly used in fine jewelry worldwide.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              It's important to understand that the carat rating can also impact the durability and strength of the gold piece. 24-karat gold is softer and more malleable than lower-carat ratings, which can make it more prone to scratches and dents. Lower carat ratings, like 18-karat gold, are stronger and more durable but may contain more alloy metals that can affect the color and appearance of the gold.

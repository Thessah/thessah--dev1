      content: 'The journey of Tanishq started with the launch of 15k gold watches studded with precious stones in 1994. But, it soon grew into a 22K jeweller who presented a stunning range of gold and diamond jewellery. The term Tanishq was coined by Mr. Xerxes Desai by marrying the words "Ta" representing TATA and "nishq" meaning a gold ornament and Tanishq\'s very first state-of-art jewellery factory with a proper kanigar park was set up in Hosur in Tamil Nadu'
